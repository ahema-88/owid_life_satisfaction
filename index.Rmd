“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

## 🔢 Table

```{r}
# For the dataframe raison_of_happyness
raison_of_happyness %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c(2010, 2022)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = happiness, id_cols = Country) %>% 
  select(Country, `2010`, `2022`) %>% 
  mutate(`Absolute change` = round(`2022` - `2010`, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(`Relative change` = (`2022` - `2010`) / `2010`) %>% 
  reactable(
    columns = list(`Relative change` = colDef(format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1)))
  )

```


## 🌎 Map

```{r}
raison_of_happyness %>% 
  mutate(happiness = round(happiness, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~happiness,
    color = ~happiness,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```

## 📈 Chart

```{r}

# Sample data: replace this with your actual 'raison_of_happyness' dataset
raison_of_happyness <- data.frame(
  Country = rep(c("Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Argentina", "Algeria"), each = 10),
  Year = rep(2010:2019, times = 6),
  happiness = runif(60, 5, 10) # Random happiness scores between 5 and 10
)

# Create the happiness chart
hapiness_chart <- 
  raison_of_happyness %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Argentina", "Algeria")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = happiness, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +  # Increase line width
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert the ggplot object to an interactive plotly object
interactive_chart <- ggplotly(hapiness_chart, width = 940)

# Print the interactive chart

## Advanced (Optional) 📈

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).

Note that this is not a required task, but rather a showcase of what can be achieved. The code for this will be shared when we provide the solutions for the exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)


# Crosstalk shared data
shared_hapiness <- highlight_key(raison_of_happyness)

hapiness_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_hapiness, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~happiness, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 10)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select Countries", 
  shared_hapiness, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, hapiness_plotly)
)
```

<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
